            <h2>Kabaddi</h2>
            <p>Kabbadi is the state sport of Tamil Nadu. The word "Kabbadi" is derived from the Tamil word 
               "kai-pidi" meaning "to hold hands".[1][2] It is also known as sadu-gudu.
               Kabaddi, also spelled kabbadi or kabadi, game played between two teams on opposite halves of
               a field or court. Individual players take turns crossing onto the other team’s side, repeating 
               “kabaddi, kabaddi” (or an alternate chant); points are scored by tagging as many opponents as 
               possible without being caught or taking a breath before returning to one’s home territory.  </p>

            <h2>Jallikattu</h2>
            <p>Jallikattu (or sallikkattu), also known as ta and manju virattu[2], is a traditional spectacle
               in which a Bos indicus bull, such as the Pulikulam[3] or Kangayam breeds,[4] is released into
               a crowd of people, and multiple human participants attempt to grab the large hump on the bull's
               back with both arms and hang on to it while the bull attempts to escape. Participants hold the
               hump for as long as possible, attempting to bring the bull to a stop. In some cases,
               participants must ride long enough to remove flags on the bull's horns. Jallikattu is typically
               practised in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu as a part of Pongal celebrations on Mattu Pongal day</p>

            <h2>Malyutham</h2>
            <p>Malyutham is a traditional Indian art of full contact Grappling that originated in Tamil Nadu. 
              It was widely practiced in Tamil Nadu since ancient times as a sport.Malla-yuddha incorporates 
              grappling, joint-breaking, punching, biting, choking and pressure point striking. Matches were
              traditionally codified into four types which progressed from purely sportive contests of strength to
              actual full-contact fights known as yuddha.[3] Due to the extreme violence, this final form is generally 
              no longer practised. The second form, wherein the wrestlers attempt to lift each other off the ground for
              three seconds, still exists in south India.</p>
